# JTR Mobile PrimeNG Theme

You find further information on this website: https://primeng.org/theming

If you want to style a PrimeNG component for the JTR 2.0 (https://github.com/Nalochen/jtr-2.0) you can use this repository.
This repository is a copy of the primeng theming repository except the "jtr"-folder is the specific JTR theme.

## How to use

1. Run `npm install jtr-primeng-mobile`
2. Include the path `node_modules/jtr-primeng-mo/themes/jtr-primeng-mobile.css` in your angular.json file

## How to contribute

1. Clone this repository
2. Create a new branch with the name of your ticket
3. Feel free to style the components in the variables-folder
4. Update version in the package.json file and create a fitting entry in the CHANGELOG.md file
5. Commit all your changes
6. Create a pull request and merge your branch into the main branch
7. Publish the library on github
8. Publish new version of the library on github
9. Update this library in the jtr project
10. Commit all your changes
11. Create a pull request and merge your branch into the main branch

## Things to come:

I am planning to set up a small angular project in this repository where all components are visible,
so that you can see how your changes affect the components.

Also, I want to directly link this repository to the JTR Repository, so that you don't have to copy the css file manually.
